## Overview
The `swaglm` package is a fast implementation of the Sparse Wrapper Algorithm (SWAG) for Generalized Linear Models (GLM). SWAG is a meta-learning procedure that combines screening and wrapper methods to efficiently find strong low-dimensional attribute combinations for prediction. Additionally, the package provides functions to visualize and extract information from the selected models as well as a statistical test to assess whether the selected models extract meaningful information from the data. For more details, see the [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12837).

## Features
- Efficiently finds a set of low-dimensional learners with high predictive accuracy.
- Follows a forward-step method to iteratively build strong learners.
- Provides a permutation-based statistical test (`swaglm_test`) to determine if the obtained models capture meaningful structure in the data.
- Uses entropy-based network measures (entropy of frequency and entropy of eigenvalue centrality) to compare SWAG models against randomized models.

Below are instructions on how to install and make use of the `swaglm` package.

## Installation Instructions


The `swaglm` package is available on both CRAN and GitHub. The CRAN
version is considered stable while the GitHub version is subject to
modifications/updates which may lead to installation problems or broken
functions. You can install the stable version of the `swaglm` package
with:

``` r
install.packages("swaglm")
```

For users who are interested in having the latest developments, the
GitHub version is ideal although more dependencies are required to run a
stable version of the package. 

``` r
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("devtools"))

# Install/Update the package from GitHub
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/swaglm")

# Install the package with Vignettes/User Guides 
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/swaglm", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


### External `R` libraries

The `swaglm` package relies on a limited number of external libraries, but notably on `Rcpp` and `RcppArmadillo` which require a `C++` compiler for installation, such as for example `gcc`.




## Getting started

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(swaglm)
```


```{r}
# Simulated data
n <- 2000
p <- 50
X <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = n, mu = rep(0, p), Sigma = diag(rep(1 / p, p)))
beta <- c(-15, -10, 5, 10, 15, rep(0, p - 5))

# generate from logistic regression model
z <- 1 + X %*% beta
pr <- 1 / (1 + exp(-z))
set.seed(12345)
y <- as.factor(rbinom(n, 1, pr))
y <- as.numeric(y) - 1

# Run SWAG
swaglm_obj <- swaglm(
  X = X, y = y, p_max = 20, family = binomial(),
  alpha = 0.15, verbose = TRUE, seed = 123
)
print(swaglm_obj)

# plot network
swaglm_network_obj <- compute_network(swaglm_obj)
plot(swaglm_network_obj, scale_vertex = 1)

# Run statistical test
B <- 20
test_results <- swaglm_test(swaglm_obj, B = B, verbose = TRUE)

# View p-values for both entropy-based measures
print(test_results)
```

## How the statistical test works

The function `swaglm_test()` performs a permutation test to evaluate whether the selected variables contain meaningful information or are randomly selected.

Null Hypothesis: The selected models are no different from randomly chosen ones.

### Procedure:

- The response variable is shuffled to break its true relationship with predictors.

- SWAG is applied to these shuffled datasets.

- The entropy of variable frequency and eigenvalue centrality is computed for the null models.

- p-values are computed by comparing the SWAG network with these null models.

### Interpretation:

- Small p-value (< 0.05): The selected variables are likely informative.

- Large p-value (â‰¥ 0.05): The selection may be random.
