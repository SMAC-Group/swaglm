Description: Provides a fast implementation of the SWAG algorithm for Generalized Linear Models which allows to perform a meta-learning procedure that combines 
    screening and wrapper methods to find a set of extremely low-dimensional attribute combinations. The package provides functions to visualize and extract information of selected models and allows to perform a test on the network of selected models to identify the variables that are highly predictive by using entropy-based network measures.
