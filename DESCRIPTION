Description: Provides a fast implementation of the SWAG algorithm for Generalized Linear Models which allows to perform a meta-learning procedure that combines 
    screening and wrapper methods to find a set of extremely low-dimensional attribute combinations. The package then performs test on the network of variables identified as highly predictive.
